# Maven Toy Sales

In this repository you will find a small project done on Maven Analytic's Data Playground's fictional dataset about a national chain of toy stores. Using SQL, I was able to analyze specific information about the toy sales patterns, trends, and answer questions about possible sales. Additionally, I used Tableau to visualize the information and trends in the analysis.
